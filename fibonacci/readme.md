# Fibonacci Sequence Function
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.<br>

Let's begin by referring to Fibonacci as **F**.

Now, let's write the formula for it.

**F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)**

**Where:**
- F(n) is term number n
- F(n-1) is the previous term
- F(n-2) is the term before that

**For example,**

F(11) = F(11-1) + (11-2)

F(11) = 89

There are written some test cases and you need to pass them and push your codes to your github repo
